## Notes

Some challenges while building the app:
1. Ensuring the header and hamburger menu behaved correctly on page load and on scroll.
2. Debugging the menu toggle state to hide the close icon(X) properly when refreshing.
3. Aligning the color scheme and responsiveness to look good on esktop and mobile
